# parse-tellabs-inventory

Hi this is my first repository that i worked on. The purpose this repository to automate inventory from raw show hw-inventory to csvfiles. That may useful for reporting purpose.

Requirement to running this script
+ Python 3
+ Library textfsm from https://github.com/jonathanslenders/textfsm

TBH im still learn python, maybe you will find some anomaly or bugs during runn those script. I create 2 files for source textfsm : tellabs-sfp and tellabs-module. 

+ tellabs-sfp : generate output based on sfp
+ tellabs-module : generate output based on module

I still cant combine both function into single file. I open feedback through my email randymukti@gmail.com
